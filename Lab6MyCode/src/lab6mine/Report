The first thing I noticed when the umple files generated was the 
length of the files. It is much more careful with errors than I am. 
It also creates new methods to simplify more complex methods.
My code did not have getters and setters for every variable. All of the umple methods
interacted with each other to accomplish what my program was supposed to. 
My code also did not flesh out all of the methods while the umple generation did create 
and implement the methods to provide the functionality that my code was outlining. 
The umple code managed to understand was the point of this project was
just by knowing the classes and instance variables. 
Possible advantages to using this software are that it is very detailed and exact. Also, 
it is faster than writing all of this code by hand. The umple code also has many more 
automatically generated comments that are displayed in a way that is common to programmers.
Another advantage is that it automatically generates the constructors. 
Some disadvantages include the fact that the code become potentially more complex than is
needed. It also could misunderstand some of the code entered. For example, the generated 
Account class has two lists for the orders, one instance variable that I put in, 
and one that it generated due to the relationship between the classes. It also did 
not understand that I wanted an array, so it automatically generated a list. In the end, 
this is much faster than writing all of this code, and this code is functioning. 
This generation can act as a good starting point for the creation of a project.
